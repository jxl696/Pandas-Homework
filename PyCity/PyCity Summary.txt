From the table that compares school spending vs scores, the lowest spending range had an overall passing rate of 95.035% while the highest spending range had onl a 73.649%.

We can also see that smaller/medium sized schools(94.82 and 95.19% respectively) have a significant larger passing rate (76.36%).

Finally it seems that Charter schools are more successful than District schools as Charter has an overall passing rate of 95.10% while District only has a 73.67%
